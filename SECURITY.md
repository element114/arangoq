# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This crate is in a pre-release state, at this point minor version changes are used for backward compatibility changes.
Security fixes will be published as a patch version on the most recent minor version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security bugs by email to <trust@reedwolf.com> to disclose it privately.
Don't forget to mention which project you found the bug in, as we deal with multiple repositories.
We will pick it up and Create a `Github Security Advisory` and invite you to the **private discussion**.
Once a reasonable fix is agreed on we will:

- Release the fix
- May yank affected versions
- Publish the  `Github Security Advisory`
- Submit an advisory to [rustsec/advisory-db](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db).

Any improvments to security related tests are welcome, use the same process as above, as these might uncover further problems.

Thank you.
